            <p>Shola Lawal is a Nigerian based journalist reporting on Africa and North America. She won the 2020 inaugural Pulitzer Prize for audio reporting for her story on This American Life about the human impact of the Trump administration’s “Remain in Mexico” policy. The story is a wrenching account of a father and son, asylum seekers from Honduras, who are kidnapped immediately after being sent to Mexico to wait for their court hearings. Emily exposed the dark underbelly of how cartels prey on migrants, using powerful first-hand accounts and recordings of cartels attempting to negotiate ransom for the father and son. She has also reported on a wide range of topics, everything from the explosion of cartel violence in Baja California to the growing passion for mixed martial arts (MMA) in Latin America. She works in print and radio, with the occasional dive into video. During the coronavirus pandemic, she has been sheltering in her hometown of Atlanta and reporting for WABE/NPR on the Ahmaud Arbery shooting, poultry workers and other topics. She started her journalism career in the Philippines on a Fulbright fellowship, reporting on human rights abuses and the dangers faced by local journalists. Emily worked as a legal affairs reporter in California for The Daily Journal newspaper from 2010 to 2015, and as the City Hall reporter for The San Francisco Chronicle from 2015 to 2017. In her free time, Emily dances around the house alone and dreams of salsa dancing with friends when the pandemic ends.</p>
