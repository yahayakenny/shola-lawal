            <h5>Shola Lawal is an independent filmmaker and freelance journalist reporting on West Africa for The New York Times, The Fuller Project, The Telegraph, The Economist and more. Lawal is currently based in Lagos, Nigeria. Her work focuses on development, women and the environment. 

              Lawal has reported from West Africa and Europe. She reported with the New York Times and the Boston Globe in 2019 as the IWMF Elizabeth Neuffer Fellow, filing stories from the United States and Mexico. She was also the recipient of the 2019 Future Awards Prize for Journalism.
              
              In 2020, Lawal was awarded the 2020 European Commission’s Lorenzo Natali Prize for Best Emerging Journalist for her reporting on Africans migrating through the dangerous jungles of South America, only to get turned away Mexico and the US. The story was published on Equal Times.
              
              Lawal is the creator of an MIT-premiered documentary, Ile Ifa, which chronicles the lives of indigenous faith believers in Nigeria who face discrimination.
              
              Lawal graduated from the University of Lagos with a Bachelor's (2015) and Masters (2018) in Mass Communication.
